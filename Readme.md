tab fill function; also fills from any part of the word to be filled

#4th change
Merging of the branch
first check the differences; use git diff nameOfBranch.

merging on github; not just yet.
pushing branch to github; git push -u(--set-upstream) branchname;or git push origin adding-html.

#5th change
Pull Requests-PRs.

#6th change
its actually quite easy. 
it's a merging request; requesting the main branch to pull in the branch;

#7th change
Undoing the changes from git
git reset HEAD~1 == unstages the previous(~1) commit
git log == shows a list of all commits,
            you could then copy the hash ðŸ¤· and run
            git reset hashValue == unstages those commits
git reset --hard hash == deletes changes that point onwards

#Updating clones
git branch -m ma main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
