The dreaded "fatal: cannot be resolved to branch" error!

Don't worry, I'm here to help you troubleshoot.

The error message "fatal: cannot be resolved to branch" usually occurs when Git is unable to find a remote branch that matches the name of your local branch. Here are some common reasons that might cause this error:

1. **Remote branch doesn't exist:** Make sure that the remote branch you're trying to push to actually exists on the remote repository. You can check this by visiting the GitHub repository and checking the list of branches.
2. **Typo in branch name:** Double-check that you're using the correct name for your local branch. A single typo can cause this error.
3. **Incorrect origin:** Make sure that you're pointing to the correct origin (remote repository) by running `git remote -v`. This command will list all the remote repositories associated with your local repository.
4. **Branch not pushed:** If you've created a new branch locally, but haven't pushed it to the remote repository yet, you won't be able to push it again.

To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. **Check the remote branch:** Run `git ls-remote --heads origin` to list all the remote branches on the `origin` repository. This will help you verify that the branch exists and has the correct name.
2. **Reset your local branch:** If you're sure that the branch exists on the remote repository, try resetting your local branch to match the remote branch:
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/my-branch
```
Replace `my-branch` with the name of your local branch.
3. **Push your local changes:** Try pushing your local changes again using `git push -u origin my-branch`.
4. **Delete and re-create your local branch:** If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting your local branch and re-creating it:
```bash
git checkout master
git branch -d my-branch
git checkout -b my-branch
```
This will delete your local branch and then re-create it, which might help resolve any issues.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your Git setup, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot!
