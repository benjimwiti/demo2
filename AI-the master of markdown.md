To push your local branch to the original GitHub repository, you'll need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Make sure you're in the correct directory**

Change into the directory where you cloned the repository:
```
cd tic-tac-toe
```
**Step 2: Add the remote tracking branch**

Use the `git branch` command to add the remote tracking branch:
```
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master my-branch
```
Replace `my-branch` with the name of your local branch, and `origin/master` with the name of the remote branch you want to track.

**Step 3: Push your local branch to the remote repository**

Use the `git push` command to push your local branch to the remote repository:
```
git push -u origin my-branch
```
The `-u` option tells Git to set the upstream tracking information for your local branch. This allows you to use `git push` and `git pull` without specifying the remote branch.

**What's happening behind the scenes:**

When you run `git push`, Git will:

1. Create a new branch on the remote repository with the same name as your local branch.
2. Push your local commits to the remote branch.
3. Set the upstream tracking information for your local branch.

**Tips and variations:**

* If you want to push all branches to the remote repository, use `git push -u origin --all`.
* If you want to push a specific commit or range of commits, use `git push -u origin <commit-hash>`.
* If you want to force-push (replace) your local branch with a new one, use `git push -f origin my-branch`.

**Common errors:**

* If you get an error message like "remote origin already exists", it means that you've already pushed changes to this repository. You can simply run `git push` again without specifying the `-u` option.
* If you get an error message like "permission denied", it means that you don't have permission to write to the remote repository. You may need to check your GitHub credentials or contact your repository administrator.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to push your local branch to the original GitHub repository.
